# CyberEz - Cybersecurity Binary Analysis Platform

A modern, responsive web application for advanced binary analysis and cybersecurity threat detection. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Project Overview

CyberEz is a static UI implementation of a cybersecurity platform that enables users to:
- Upload and analyze binary files
- Track analysis jobs in real-time
- View comprehensive security reports
- Understand the analysis pipeline

**Note:** This is the static UI scaffolding. Backend logic, animations, 3D visualizations, and dynamic data will be added in future iterations.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Modern UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality UI components
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon system

## 🎨 Design System

The application features a dark cybersecurity theme with:
- **Colors:** Dark backgrounds with cyan/blue accents
- **Typography:** Space Grotesk (display) + Inter (body)
- **Components:** Custom-styled shadcn components
- **Effects:** Cyber-grid patterns, glowing borders, smooth transitions
